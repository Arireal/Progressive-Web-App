# 🛍️ Storefront Portfolio with React, Node.js & and Express.js

A **full-stack e-commerce storefront** that dynamically displays products from multiple retailers using **React, Node.js, and Express.js**. This project covers **UX/UI design, frontend development, and backend integration** to create a functional and visually appealing storefront.

For the Backend I used a Polyrepo Setup: For this project, the frontend and backend are maintained in independent repositories. This approach, known as a polyrepo, offers a cleaner separation between concerns (frontend and backend) and allows for independent scaling and management of each part. It's an ideal choice for larger projects or when the frontend and backend are expected to evolve separately. This separation also enables more flexible deployment and easier collaboration between teams working on different parts of the system.
