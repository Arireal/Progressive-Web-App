# 🛍️ Storefront Portfolio with React, Node.js & and Express.js

This is a **full-stack e-commerce application built using React for the frontend and Node.js/Express for the backend**. The project demonstrates a robust and scalable architecture, real-time inventory management, and seamless user experience.

The application fetches product data in real-time using **API calls** and displays it dynamically. **React hooks** like useState and useEffect are used to manage state changes and ensure a smooth, dynamic UI.

This project highlights my ability to work with modern full-stack technologies and create highly interactive and performant user interfaces.

🖥️ **Backend API:** [Hosted on Server](https://your-backend-url.com)
